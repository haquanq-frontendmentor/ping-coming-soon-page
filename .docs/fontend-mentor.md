## What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

Hello guys 👋👋👋

This is a small challenge but i have done my best to complete it!! Much more to learn and thanks to FEM team.

🚀 **Built with**

- Mobile-first workflow
- ARIA specifications
- Semantic HTML
- Pure CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

🐲 **What i have done**

- Accessible form for screen readers
- Overridden default effect on focus (buttons, inputs, links).
- Used my own judgement to achieve **95% similar** to the design without Figma files.
